		<li>Honey bees must gather nectar from two million flowers to make one pound of honey.</li>
		<li>One bee has to fly about 90,000 miles, three times around the globe, to make one pound of honey.</li>
		<li>The average bee will make only 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime.</li>
		<li>A honey bee visits 50 to 100 flowers during a collection trip.</li>
		<li>A honey bee can fly for up to six miles, and as fast as 15 miles per hour.</li>
		<li>The bee's brain is about the size of a sesame seed, yet it has a great capacity to learn and remember things. For example, it is able to make complex calculations on distance travelled and foraging efficiency.
		<li>Honey bees communicate with one another by dancing.</li>
		<li>A colony of bees consists of 20,000-60,000 honey bees and one queen. Worker honey bees are female, live for about 6 weeks and do all the work.</li>
		<li>The queen bee can live up to 5 years and is the only bee that lays eggs. She is the busiest in the summer months, when the hive needs to be at its maximum strength, and lays up to 2500 eggs per day.</li>
		<li>Larger than the worker bees, the male honey bees (also called drones), have no stinger and do no work. All they do is mate.</li>
		<li>Honey bees have been producing honey in the same way for 150 million years.</li>
